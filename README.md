## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
Hello, I'm Lucas Santos, a data science programmer. I'm passionate about computing and mathematics. I have advanced skills in Python, intermediate knowledge of SQL and English. Currently, I'm studying statistics to enhance my expertise.

## Expertise ðŸš€
I am passionate about analyzing data and turning it into useful insights for decision-making. I am studying data science concepts such as statistics and using Python along with libraries to assist in both coding and data analysis, as well as for the creation of AIs. I have been programming for 6 months and am evolving day by day.

I have advanced knowledge in Python with a focus on data science, along with expertise in data analysis and automation. I am constantly updating my GitHub with study projects to enhance my skills in programming languages and surrounding areas that are crucial.

I'm dedicating my time to studying SQL to enhance my knowledge in data management, understand the significance of indices in optimizing query performance and execution speed, as well as grasp the concepts of SQL transactions, concurrency control, and data integrity assurance in multi-user environments. Additionally, I'm seeking to familiarize myself with recommended practices to ensure data security, including access control and user permissions.
